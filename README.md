Assessment
 Hi Stephen
 
Please see the code in the folder web-app.
I tested it on JSFiddle and other similar platforms and it works but in Eclispe and from the CMD line I keep getting errors relating to 
jquery. I am still working on it but as you mentioned I have 48 hours so thought I would send you the progress thus far.
I will find the solution asap and keep you posted.

Please keep in touch and I hope to hear from you.

Thanks Clayton
